# bunny_battle_python
A project I created for fun. It is a remake of another python project which was built for southern utah code camp 2015 by my family.
It was originally written in python 2 but has been somewhat ported to python 3 with a few warnings.
A game with powerups, killer bunnies, and explosions, what else is there to have?
